# Title: Stock Market Prediction Using ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet Models

Description: This project aims to predict stock prices for Tesla (TSLA) using three advanced time series forecasting techniques: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, and Prophet. The project leverages historical stock price data, applies rigorous data preprocessing techniques, and implements each model to forecast stock prices for December 2022. The results from each model are compared to assess their accuracy and suitability for financial market predictions. The project is intended for financial analysts, data scientists, and anyone interested in the application of machine learning and statistical models to financial forecasting.

Key Features:
	-Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
	-ARIMA Model: Statistical approach to model and forecast time series data by analyzing linear patterns.
	-LSTM Model: A deep learning model designed to capture long-term dependencies and non-linear patterns in time series data.
	-Prophet Model: An additive model developed by Facebook for forecasting time series data, accounting for seasonality and trends.
	-Model Comparison: Detailed analysis and comparison of the performance of ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet models on Tesla stock data.
	-Visualization: Comprehensive visualizations of the actual vs. predicted stock prices for each model.
